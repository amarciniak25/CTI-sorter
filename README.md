# CTI-sorter
This script reads application data from sorter.csv and uses a genetic algorithm to aid the Charlotte Teacherâ€™s Institute in their admissions process.

The program begins by creating a single random solution it then creates a number of variants of that solution.

It selects the most fit member of the family it's created and uses that as the seed for the next generation.

The program makes heavy usage of multi-dimensional arrays and hashes.
